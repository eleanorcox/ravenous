# Ravenous

A React app to search for restaurants using the Yelp API.

Search by 'Best Match', 'Highest Rated' or 'Most Reviewed'. As this uses the Yelp API it searches for USA-based businesses first, so please specify 'UK' if looking for UK-based businesses (e.g. 'Bristol, UK').

To run, navigate to the root directory and type **npm start** to run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
